Just finished the piano final concert and I (probably) fucked up something. However, I finally have at least some time to work on this website although it seems that there might not be so many people reading these. Below are some ambitions for things needed to do in the winter break.

- Go through the materials of Algo and try to have some reflections.

- Review the materials of ML and try to write something down.

- Reorganize the notes for Computer Architecture and publish it on this website.

- Thats really a lot of work to do so no more, I'll add more if needed in the comments area.
