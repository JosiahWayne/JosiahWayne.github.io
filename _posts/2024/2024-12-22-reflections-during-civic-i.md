# Preface

I have had this kind of idea for a really long time, which is to write a semesterly reflection and have a summary about this semester. However, I have been too lazy and have done nothing in the past 2 years (lol). I decide to end this and start my semesterly reflection now(cuz the civic is too boring......)

For the format of every semester, I would like to do this thing in the format below.

Course Reflection -> Activity Reflection -> Learning Outcome Reflection -> Future Expectations

# So let's start with Course Reflection.

This semester I took five courses, which is 18 credits. The five courses are,

- Multivariable Calculus

- Probability and Statistics

- Data Structures

- Computer Architecture

- Piano for Inter Beginners

For Multivariable Calculus, I don't think I put as much effort into it as I did in FA23. And I really don't want to talk about it that much, I think I will modify this after get the grade for Multi.

For Prob&Stats, I took this course as the pre for Machine Learning. And I also don't think I really learned that much in this course... But it does help me build some concepts in this field.

Humm and I think maybe I should say something about CA and DS, I really appreciate the effort of Professor Tam and Sven. I have to admit that the Data Structures course I took is one of the best courses I have taken in NYUSH and maybe the best CS course I have taken till now. They really have a well-structured course outline, a natural build-up of the knowledge, and a very solid mechanism for students to know how well they are learning and what kind of effort they should pay to get higher grade for this course.

However, the DS course still has some shortcomings, but I think this is one of the shortcomings of all NYUSH courses, which is they have a relatively slow learning rate, this actually made it harder for students to learn a lot in this course, and they have to seek some out-class materials in order to get a same learning outcome with the CS students in ordinary Chinese universities. But actually, I don't consider this as a problem of the course but an outcome of the synergistic effect of the university and the students.

Lastly, I want to talk about CA, which is computer architecture. This course was originally taught by a different professor, and Professor Xianbin Gu has been teaching this course since this semester. This actually leads to a very interesting situation. The professor actually doesn't know that much in this field, and he is preparing for this course from zero. This means you actually can learn this course totally by yourself as the professor might not know that much. Most of the time Google and ChatGPT is better professor.

Oh, I have to mention that I also took the Piano course this semester. In the beginning, I wanted to play the whole Animal version of Sparkle. However, I failed to do that in the end, as I had to put more effort into the other course.

And as I am too lazy, I decide to split this into parts and I'll write more in the afternoon.
